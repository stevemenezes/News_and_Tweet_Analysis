# News_and_Tweet_Analysis

Currently, there has been work done in clustering the news or tweets separately. The news are divided into categories and their sub-categories. But, there has not been much work done to find the correspondence between the news and the tweets. I feel it is important to analyze whether the news covered all the topics which were important to the users. This is necessary as the news may not contain the topics of interest of the users and many people rely on news for daily updates. So, my analysis using the correspondence between the two would help to achieve this i.e. finding out the missing news.
